# SoundCuer
A Plugin to "link" Sounds to Cues in a Sequence. It Rads all Sounds out of the pool and then gives you the option which sounds to store and in which sequence to store them.

BE CAREFUL!!
You CANNOT CANCEL the plugin once it's startet. Currently the Plugin overrides the Sequence you give, if the given slot is not empty!
